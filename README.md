# Description

AICommits is a Python script that generates a git commit message using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The script takes the git diff of the staged changes and generates a commit message using GPT-3.

The generated commit message is presented to the user who has the option to accept or reject it. If the user accepts the commit message, the script commits the changes using the generated message.

The script requires an OpenAI API key, which can be obtained from the OpenAI website.

# Dependencies

    Python 3.6 or higher
    openai 0.10.2
    inquirer 3.7.0
    python-dotenv 0.19.1

# Features

In this version, AICommit provides the following features:

- Automatic generation of commit messages based on the diff of staged changes.
    
- Support for conventional commit messages.
- Language selection for generated commit messages.
- User selection of generated commit messages.
- Support for specifying diff per file.

# Installation and Usage

To use AICommits, do the following: 

1. Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable by running:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```


2. install aicommit from pypi by running:

```bash
pip install ai_commits
```

Then, run the script using the command `aicommit`.

This will prompt AICOMMIT to generate up to 5 commit messages based on the diff of staged changes. The user can then select one of the generated commit messages to use as the commit message for their changes.

If the --diff-per-file flag is included, AICOMMIT will generate separate commit messages for each file.

If the --conventional flag is included, AICOMMIT will generate commit messages in conventional commit format.

If the --language flag is included, AICOMMIT will generate commit messages in the specified language.

3. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

4. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable by running export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY.
    
5. Run the script using the command `python "src/ai_commits.py"`.
